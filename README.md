### Hello, I'm Henrique Migotto, and I am currently delving into the world of Go programming. I am drawn to this language because of its harmonious blend of simplicity and efficiency. While I do have a fondness for Rust, I find that Go is easier to understand and work with at present. Rest assured, I will still be utilizing Rust for WebAssembly projects. As a developer, I am constantly driven by my curious nature and a desire to know everything in detail. This is why I plan to undertake more public projects here on GitHub in the near future, as I continue my journey of learning and discovery.
